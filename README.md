# IJC
Projects to course: `Language C`

# Project 1
The first homework assignment for the C programming language course involves implementing various tasks in C11 standard. Key aspects include creating a bit array with operations such as initialization, dynamic allocation, and setting/getting bits, managed via macros or inline functions. An essential component is the implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to calculate prime numbers.

# Project 2
The second homework assignment for the C programming language course features two primary tasks, both requiring implementation in C11 standard. The first task involves creating a program called "tail.c" that mimics the functionality of the POSIX tail command by displaying the last specified number of lines from a given input file or stdin, utilizing a dynamic circular buffer for storage. The second task is to translate a C++ program into C, which involves counting word occurrences in text using a hash table implemented in a separate library. This includes creating a specialized hash function and managing dynamic memory allocations.
